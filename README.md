# Dockerized with VSCode Remote Containers using Docker Compose

For a simpler example, without Docker Compose, see [this example](../vscode-remote-container/).

This example shows how to set up _dockerized_ to use the Docker Compose file defined in the `.devcontainer` folder that the VSCode Remote Containers feature uses.

This allows you to have a single definition for a development environment which can be used both by VSCode and _dockerized_ (outside VSCode, for example in a CI server).
